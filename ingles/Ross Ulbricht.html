        <h2>Who is Ross Ulbricht?</h2>
        <p>Ross Ulbricht is the founder and creator of Silk Road, an online marketplace that operated on the dark web. Born in 1984, Ross was arrested in 2013 and sentenced for multiple charges related to the operation of Silk Road, a platform that allowed users to buy and sell products anonymously, including drugs, weapons, and other illegal goods. Despite his initial intentions of creating a market to promote economic freedom, the site quickly became a hub for illegal activities.</p>
        
        <h2>The Legal Case</h2>
        <p>In 2015, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, a sentence that sparked intense debate about the punishment he should have received for his actions. Many civil rights and online privacy advocates argue that the sentence was excessive, while others believe it was a fitting punishment for the negative impact Silk Road had on society.</p>
