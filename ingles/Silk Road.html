        <h2>What is Silk Road?</h2>
        <p>Silk Road was an online marketplace operating on the dark web, launched in 2011 by an anonymous individual known as "Dread Pirate Roberts." It was famous for allowing users to buy and sell illegal goods, primarily drugs, with the use of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) to maintain anonymity. Silk Road aimed to create a free marketplace that promoted economic liberty without government interference, but quickly became notorious for facilitating illicit activities.</p>
        
        <h2>The Rise and Fall</h2>
        <p>Silk Road quickly grew into one of the most well-known websites on the dark web, attracting users from all over the world. Its success was largely due to its focus on anonymity, both for buyers and sellers. However, in 2013, the FBI shut down Silk Road and arrested its alleged creator, Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht was charged with operating the site and facilitating the illegal transactions conducted there. Despite its closure, Silk Road left a lasting impact on the digital underground economy.</p>
